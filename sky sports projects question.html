By using MySQL to analyze data on team and player performance, the analyst will deliver valuable insights that will help viewers understand the intricacies of the game and the factors that can make or break a team's success at the FIFA World Cup.</div><div><br></div><div>In our case study, we have two tables, group_stage_team_stats and overall_wc_stats that are being used by the Sports Analyst at Sky Sports Channel to provide detailed statistics and insights on the FIFA World Cup matches. The first table, group_stage_team_stats, which contains information on each team's performance in each game, has columns such as team name, game date, goals scored, goals conceded, shots on target, shots off target, possession, and many more. The second table, overall_wc_stats , which contains overall statistics of each team at the current FIFA World Cup, has columns such as player name, position, number of appearances, goals scored, assists, yellow and red cards, and other relevant information.
